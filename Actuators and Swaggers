Actuators

Spring Boot Actuator is a production-ready feature that provides built-in endpoints to monitor, manage, and observe the health, metrics, and internal state of a Spring Boot application.

It provides built-in endpoints that give insights into your application's:

Health

Metrics

Environment

Beans

Logs

Thread dumps

HTTP traces

👉 In simple terms:
Spring Boot Actuator = “Monitoring + Management layer” for your Spring Boot application



Swagger

Swagger in Spring Boot is used to automatically generate interactive API documentation for your REST APIs. 
It helps developers understand, test, and integrate APIs without reading backend code.
