1. What is AOP and why is it used in Spring Boot?

Answer:
AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming) is used to separate cross-cutting concerns like logging, security, and transactions from business logic.

👉 This improves:

Code reusability

Clean architecture

Maintainability

2. What are cross-cutting concerns? Give examples.

Answer:
Concerns that affect multiple parts of an application.

Examples:

Logging

Authentication

Transactions

Exception handling

3. What are the main AOP concepts?

Answer:

Aspect → class containing cross-cutting logic

Advice → action performed (before/after)

JoinPoint → method execution point

Pointcut → expression to select methods

Proxy → object that applies aspect

4. What is the difference between @Before and @Around advice?
Feature	@Before	@Around
Execution	Before method	Before + After
Can control method call	❌ No	✅ Yes
Can change return value	❌ No	✅ Yes
5. What is a Pointcut expression?

Answer:
A pointcut expression defines which methods the advice applies to.

Example:

@Pointcut("execution(* com.app.service.*.*(..))")

👉 Means all methods in service package.

6. Explain execution() syntax in AOP

Answer:

execution(return-type package.class.method(args))

Example:

execution(* com.bank.service.AccountService.transfer(..))

7. What is JoinPoint vs ProceedingJoinPoint?
JoinPoint	ProceedingJoinPoint
Used in Before/After	Used in Around
Cannot control execution	Can call proceed()

8. How does Spring AOP work internally?

Answer:
Spring AOP uses proxy-based mechanism.

Flow:

Client → Proxy → Target Object

Proxy intercepts method calls and applies aspects.

9. What is JDK Dynamic Proxy vs CGLIB?
Feature	JDK Proxy	CGLIB
Needs interface	Yes	No
Creates proxy using	Interface	Subclass
Performance	Faster	Slightly slower

10. What is @EnableAspectJAutoProxy?

Answer:
It enables AOP support in Spring Boot.

@EnableAspectJAutoProxy

11. What is self-invocation problem in AOP?

Answer:
When a method inside a class calls another method in the same class, AOP does not work because proxy is bypassed.

12. How does @Transactional use AOP internally?

Answer:
Spring creates a transaction proxy:

Start transaction

Execute method

Commit or rollback

13. What are different types of Advice in Spring AOP?

Answer:

@Before

@After

@AfterReturning

@AfterThrowing

@Around

14. What are limitations of Spring AOP?

Answer:

Only works on public methods

Only method execution join points

Self-invocation problem

Proxy-based (runtime only)

15. Give real-time use cases of AOP in projects

Answer:

In real projects AOP is used for:

✔ Logging API requests
✔ Security checks
✔ Transaction management
✔ Performance monitoring
✔ Audit logging

Example:

@Around("execution(* com.app.service.*.*(..))")
public Object logTime(ProceedingJoinPoint pjp) throws Throwable {
    long start = System.currentTimeMillis();
    Object result = pjp.proceed();
    long end = System.currentTimeMillis();
    System.out.println("Time taken: " + (end - start));
    return result;
}
