difference between jar and war 
JAR is used for standalone Java applications with an embedded server, while WAR is used for web applications that are deployed on external servlet containers like Tomcat.

is Jar able to do the work of war ?
Yes, a JAR can do the work of a WAR in modern Spring Boot applications, because it contains an embedded web server (Tomcat/Jetty) and can run a web application independently.
but still There are still situations where WAR is required
1️⃣ Organization uses external server
2️⃣ Multiple apps on same server
