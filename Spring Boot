difference between jar and war 
JAR is used for standalone Java applications with an embedded server, while WAR is used for web applications that are deployed on external servlet containers like Tomcat.

is Jar able to do the work of war ?
Yes, a JAR can do the work of a WAR in modern Spring Boot applications, because it contains an embedded web server (Tomcat/Jetty) and can run a web application independently.
but still There are still situations where WAR is required
1️⃣ Organization uses external server
2️⃣ Multiple apps on same server

🟢 BASIC LEVEL (15 Questions)
1. What is Spring Framework and why do we use it?

Answer:

Spring is a lightweight Java framework for building enterprise applications.

Provides IoC (Inversion of Control) and DI (Dependency Injection).

Use Case:
Banking app service layer decoupled from DAO using DI.

Common Mistake: Saying “Spring is only for web apps”.

Follow-up: What problems does Spring solve compared to EJB?

Tip: Say loosely coupled, testable, maintainable.

2. What is IoC and DI?

Answer:

IoC: Control of object creation is given to Spring container.

DI: Dependencies are injected by Spring.

@Service
class PaymentService {
   private final OrderService orderService;
   public PaymentService(OrderService orderService){
       this.orderService = orderService;
   }
}

Mistake: Confusing DI with service calling service.

Follow-up: Constructor vs Setter injection?

Tip: Always prefer constructor injection.

3. What are Spring Bean scopes?

Singleton (default)

Prototype

Request

Session

Application

Use case: Request scope for HTTP request data.

Mistake: Using prototype for stateless service.

Follow-up: Why singleton is safe?


4. What is Bean lifecycle?

Instantiate

Populate dependencies

init()

ready to use

destroy()

@PostConstruct
public void init(){}

@PreDestroy
public void cleanup(){}


5. @Component vs @Service vs @Repository

@Component – generic

@Service – business logic

@Repository – persistence + exception translation

Follow-up: What is exception translation?


6. @Autowired vs @Qualifier vs @Primary

@Autowired – auto injection

@Qualifier – specify bean

@Primary – default bean


7. What is Spring Boot?

Opinionated framework

Removes boilerplate configuration

Embedded servers (Tomcat)


8. What is Auto Configuration?

Spring Boot automatically configures beans based on classpath.

Example: Add spring-boot-starter-data-jpa → Hibernate auto-configured.


9. application.properties vs YAML

.properties → key=value

.yml → hierarchical

server:
  port: 8081

10. What is Spring MVC architecture?

Flow:
Client → DispatcherServlet → Controller → Service → DAO → Response


11. What is REST?

Stateless

Resource based

HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)



12. What is @RestController?

Combination of:

@Controller + @ResponseBody


13. What is Spring Data JPA?

Simplifies database operations

Provides JpaRepository

interface UserRepo extends JpaRepository<User, Long> {}

14. What is @Transactional?

Manages DB transactions.

Mistake: Using it on private methods.


15. JAR vs WAR deployment

JAR → embedded server

WAR → external server


🟡 INTERMEDIATE LEVEL (20 Questions)
1. Constructor vs Setter Injection

Constructor → mandatory dependency

Setter → optional

Best Practice: Constructor injection.


2. What is AOP?

Aspect Oriented Programming separates cross-cutting concerns.

Examples:

Logging

Security

Transactions


3. What are AOP terminologies?

Aspect

Advice

JoinPoint

Pointcut


4. How does Spring Boot Auto Config work internally?

Uses @EnableAutoConfiguration

Reads spring.factories


5. What is DispatcherServlet?

Front controller that routes all HTTP requests.


6. Difference between @ControllerAdvice & @ExceptionHandler

@ControllerAdvice – global exception

@ExceptionHandler – specific


7. What is DTO?

Data Transfer Object used between layers.


8. What is Hibernate?

ORM tool that maps Java objects to database tables.


9. Lazy vs Eager Loading

Lazy → load when needed

Eager → load immediately


10. What is N+1 problem?

Multiple queries fired when fetching relationships.


11. What is Pagination?
Page<User> users = repo.findAll(PageRequest.of(0,10));


12. What is Spring Security?

Provides authentication and authorization.


13. JWT Authentication flow

User login

Generate JWT

Send token

Validate token for each request


14. What is Filter in Spring?

Used to intercept HTTP request before controller.


15. What are Profiles?

Used to manage environments.

spring.profiles.active=dev

16. What is Actuator?

Provides production-ready features.

Endpoints:

/health

/metrics

/info


17. Logging in Spring Boot

Uses SLF4J + Logback.


18. What is caching?

Store frequently accessed data.

@Cacheable("users")


19. Maven vs Gradle

Maven → XML

Gradle → Groovy DSL

Gradle faster

20. How do you validate input?
@Valid
@NotNull
@Size

🔴 ADVANCED LEVEL (15 Questions)
1. How do transactions work internally?

Proxy based

Uses AOP

2. Propagation types in transactions

REQUIRED

REQUIRES_NEW

SUPPORTS

3. Isolation levels

READ_COMMITTED

REPEATABLE_READ

SERIALIZABLE

4. How to handle distributed transactions?

Use Saga / 2PC

5. What is Circuit Breaker?

Resilience pattern using Resilience4j.

6. What is API Gateway?

Single entry point for microservices.

7. How to secure microservices?

JWT

OAuth2

API Gateway security

8. What is Service Discovery?

Eureka server registers services.

9. How to implement global logging?

Use AOP or filters.

10. What is Rate Limiting?

Limit number of requests per user.

11. How to design idempotent APIs?

Use idempotency key.

12. What is optimistic vs pessimistic locking?

Concurrency control techniques.

13. How do you improve performance in Spring Boot?

caching

connection pool

async processing

Actuator

Prometheus

Grafana
