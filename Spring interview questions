🟢 BASIC LEVEL (15 Questions)
1. What is Spring Framework?

Answer:
Spring is a Java framework that provides Inversion of Control (IoC) and Dependency Injection (DI) to build loosely coupled applications.

Real-time use case:
In a banking app, service classes depend on repository classes. Spring injects dependencies automatically.

2. What is IoC (Inversion of Control)?

Answer:
IoC means Spring container controls object creation and lifecycle instead of the programmer.

3. What is Dependency Injection?

Answer:
Injecting dependencies via constructor/setter instead of creating objects manually.

Example:

@Service
public class UserService {
    private final UserRepository repo;

    @Autowired
    public UserService(UserRepository repo){
        this.repo = repo;
    }
}
4. What are different types of DI?

Answer:

Constructor Injection ✅ (Recommended)

Setter Injection

Field Injection

Answer:
A bean is an object managed by the Spring container.

Feature	Filter	Interceptor
Level	Servlet	Spring MVC
Use	Logging, security	Controller pre/post handling
11. What is @Valid?

Answer:
Used for request validation.

public ResponseEntity save(@Valid @RequestBody User user)
12. What is @PathVariable vs @RequestParam?

Answer:

PathVariable → URL path

RequestParam → query param

13. What is Pageable in Spring Data?

Answer:
Used for pagination.

14. What is @Query annotation?
